DuckDB is a fast, in-memory, open-source, and free analytical database system that speaks SQL. It is heavily based on vectorization and can store and process vector embeddings using Array and List data types to enable vector search, bridging the gap between data engineering and AI workflows with fast response times. It allows users to query and transform data anywhere using its feature-rich SQL dialect.

### Features
