# MotherDuck

**Description:** MotherDuck is a cloud data warehouse that functions as a serverless cloud service for analytics, building upon the capabilities of DuckDB. It is designed to store vector embeddings as List data types, facilitating semantic search functionalities through SQL-based similarity functions within existing data pipelines.

**Origin Story:** The concept for MotherDuck emerged when co-founder Jordan Tigani, inspired by DuckDB's capabilities and his experience with Google's BigQuery, envisioned creating a serverless cloud version of the database. He collaborated with DuckDB's creators, Hannes MÃ¼hleisen and Mark Raasveldt, who were seeking a partner for a commercial cloud offering. This partnership led to the establishment of MotherDuck, with DuckDB Labs becoming a co-founder. The name "MotherDuck" was suggested by Lloyd Tabb.
