### About
Sentence-Transformers is a Python library for creating state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings. It enables the conversion of text into high-dimensional numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, which is essential for tasks like semantic search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), often leveraging vector databases.

### Features
*   **Sentence, Text, and Image Embedding Creation:** Generates high-dimensional numerical vectors from various data types.
*   **Semantic Meaning Capture:** Embeddings are designed to accurately represent the semantic content of the input.
*   **Support for Semantic Search:** Facilitates the development of systems capable of identifying semantically similar information.
*   **Integration with RAG:** A key component for building Retrieval Augmented Generation systems.
*   **Python Library:** Provides a convenient and accessible interface for Python developers.
